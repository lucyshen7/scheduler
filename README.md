# Interview Scheduler

## Welcome to my fifth project, Interview Scheduler! ðŸ“š

Interview Scheduler is a single-page application built using React (front-end) and Express (back-end). This application allows a student to book an interview with a mentor between Monday and Friday.

Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.

Jest, Storybook and Cypress tests were used throughout the development of the project.
