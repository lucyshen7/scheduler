# Interview Scheduler

## Welcome to my fifth project, Interview Scheduler! 🤓

Interview Scheduler is a single-page application built using React (front-end) and Express (back-end). 

✨ The application allows a student to book an appointment with an interviewer between noon and 5 pm, Monday to Friday. 

✨ Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.

✨ Jest, Storybook and Cypress tests were used throughout the development of the project.
